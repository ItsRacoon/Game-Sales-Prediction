# Video Game Sales Prediction

This project focuses on predicting global video game sales using machine learning techniques. By analyzing key factors such as platform, genre, publisher, and regional sales, we aim to forecast global sales accurately, enabling better decision-making for stakeholders in the gaming industry.

## Features
- Data preprocessing for handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights into the dataset.
- Model training and evaluation using Gradient Boosting Regression.
- Feature importance analysis to identify key predictors.
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted sales for performance assessment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Required Libraries
Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Dataset
Ensure the dataset is in CSV format and properly structured. Include features such as:
- `Platform`
- `Genre`
- `Publisher`
- `NA_Sales`
- `EU_Sales`
- `JP_Sales`
- `Other_Sales`
- `Global_Sales`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-game-sales-prediction.git
   cd video-game-sales-prediction
   ```

2. Place your dataset in the project directory.

3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. View results including:
   - Feature importance
   - Actual vs. Predicted sales visualization

## Results

- **Model Performance**: High RÂ² score, low Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Feature Importance**: Key features like `NA_Sales`, `EU_Sales`, and `JP_Sales` were the most influential.
- **Visualization**: Actual vs. predicted sales plotted for better understanding of model accuracy.
